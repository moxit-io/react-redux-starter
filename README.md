# React, Redux boilerplate

This boilerplate contains all you need to start your next React.js project. Simple, robust, well-organized, all you need to do is clone, install and you're ready to start.

## Features

This boilerplate features all the latest tools and practices in the industry.

-   ‚öõÔ∏è **React** ‚Äî Started with `create-react-app`
-   ‚ôª **Redux** ‚Äî State with redux dev tools
-   üëà üëâ **React router** - Routing with `react-router-dom`
-   üíÖ **CSS** ‚Äî Styled Components
-   ‚úÖ **Tests** ‚Äî Jest
-   üíñ **Lint** ‚Äî ESlint
-   üê∂ **Husky** ‚Äî Prevent bad commits

## Usage

Clone, Install dependencies, and get your hands dirty.

-   `git clone https://github.com/moxit-io/react-redux-starter.git` - clone repo
-   `cd react-redux-starter` - cd into your newly created project directory
-   `yarn install` - install dependencies
-   `yarn start` - start development server

## Boilerplate setup steps

The steps below are for reference only no need to repeat these steps in order to start using the boilerplate.

Start by creating your empty React application using `create-react-app`

```console
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

Install the following dev dependencies:

```console
yarn add --dev eslint eslint-config-airbnb eslint-config-prettier eslint-loader eslint-plugin-babel eslint-plugin-import eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y eslint-plugin-prettier eslint-plugin-react redux-logger husky lint-staged pretty-quick
```

Then, in our root folder, create a file called `.eslintrc` and put the following code there:

```json
{
    "parser": "babel-eslint",
    "extends": ["airbnb", "prettier", "prettier/react"],
    "plugins": ["prettier"],
    "parserOptions": {
        "ecmaVersion": 6,
        "ecmaFeatures": {
            "jsx": true
        }
    },
    "env": {
        "browser": true,
        "node": true,
        "mocha": true,
        "es6": true,
        "jest": true
    },
    "rules": {
        "indent": ["error", 4],
        "space-before-function-paren": "off",
        "react/prefer-stateless-function": "warn",
        "react/jsx-one-expression-per-line": "off",
        "import/no-extraneous-dependencies": [
            "error",
            { "devDependencies": true }
        ],
        "react/jsx-filename-extension": [1, { "extensions": [".js", ".jsx"] }],
        "linebreak-style": "off",
        "global-require": "off",
        "semi": "warn",
        "arrow-body-style": "off",
        "no-multiple-empty-lines": ["warn", { "max": 1 }],
        "no-unused-expressions": [
            "error",
            {
                "allowTaggedTemplates": true
            }
        ],
        "no-underscore-dangle": [
            2,
            { "allow": ["__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__"] }
        ]
    }
}
```

## Prettier

Prettier is basically a code formatter. It parses your code and re-prints it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.

You just need to install it:

```console
yarn add --dev prettier
```

And in our root folder, create a file called `.prettierrc` and put the following code there:

```json
{
    "printWidth": 80,
    "tabWidth": 4,
    "semi": true,
    "singleQuote": true,
    "bracketSpacing": true
}
```

## Redux

Redux makes it easy to manage the state of your application.

First, we‚Äôre going to install some dependencies:

```console
yarn add redux react-redux redux-thunk
```

Then, we‚Äôre going to create our Redux store, and put some state there. In our `src/redux/store` folder, create an index.js file and put that following code there:

```js
import { createStore, applyMiddleware, compose } from 'redux';
import thunk from 'redux-thunk';
import logger from 'redux-logger';

import rootReducer from '../reducers';

const middleware = applyMiddleware(thunk, logger);

const reduxDevTools =
    window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__ &&
    window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__();

const store = createStore(
    rootReducer,
    compose(
        middleware,
        reduxDevTools
    )
);

export default store;
```

Last, we‚Äôre gonna to our index.js in our src folder, and wrap the code with the `<Provider />` and pass our store as props to make it available to our application.

It‚Äôs going to be like this:

```js
import React, { Fragment } from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';

import store from './store';
import App from './components/App';

ReactDOM.render(
    <Provider store={store}>
        <App />
    </Provider>,
    document.getElementById('root')
);
```

## React Router

React Router is the standard routing library for React. Basically, it keeps your UI in sync with the URL. We‚Äôre gonna use it in our boilerplate, so install it:

```console
yarn add react-router-dom
```

After that, go to our `index.js` in our `src` folder and wrap all the code there with the `<BrowserRouter>`.

Our index.js in our src folder it‚Äôs going to end up like this:

```js
import React, { Fragment } from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';

import store from './store';
import App from './components/App';

ReactDOM.render(
    <BrowserRouter>
        <Provider store={store}>
            <App />
        </Provider>
    </BrowserRouter>,
    document.getElementById('root')
);
```

## Styled Components

Styled Components makes CSS easy for everyone, as it helps you organize your React project. Its objective is to write more small and reusable components. We‚Äôre gonna use it, and if you want to learn more about it, read up [here.](https://www.styled-components.com)

First, install it:

```console
yarn add styled-components
```

Then, in our App.js file inside our components folder, we‚Äôre going to create a simple title using Styled Components. Our title is going to be like this:

```js
const Title = styled.h1`
    color: black;
    font-size: 2.5rem;
    font-weight: 700;
`;
```
